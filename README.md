## a little note from the developer

this project hasn't successed to be deployed yet since an error accures at the very last seconds :'

there are many functions that gets error too. the developer didn't know what causing this. but the mixed up code (and the developer's brain) might be the cause of this issue. for example: the cart page suddenly didn't show up. it is hard to debug on the last minute so unfortunately the developer has to leave it this way for a moment. she says sorry, coach :'

also because there are a lot of confusions going on, the developer can't refactor and use some of react functionality that has been taught at class. this caused some chaosity in the code writing and some function can't work properly (yet). again, the developer says sorry and promise will learn and work harder in order to totally understand the whole lectures about react. she might be confused right now, so asking for a proper help might not even get to her head at the moment. again, please forgive her

this brief readme file is written to give a bief explanation of what's happening at the very last moment of the deadline. she hopes everyone who see this note (especially TL) will give her a good understanding and... accept her apology. she promise (to her self) that she won't let this happen again in the future

the developer will be very happy to receive tons of feedback (sweet or harsh) in order to give her knowledge, motivation, tips, and guide on how to learn and finalize the project perfectly

last, the developer felt sorry and hopes that her apology is accepted. hope this message finds you well. thank you :)
